![RVGM logo](data/logos/system-logo.png)

RVGM is the new name of my old XVGM project i've started on 2014 on XBOX.
- XVGM was a video skin for UnleashX, on the first Xbox, to launch Madmab and other emulators.
The Xbox Video Game Museum was abandoned because i have so many memory problems/crash and the xbox is now to old ... with old gamepad, no HDMI, not enough powerful for some new systems like Nintendo DS, etc ...

- RVGM : Retro/Retropie Video Game Musuem, is the new project designed to work on Retropie, with EmulationStation on a PI.

This skin is designed to show and write maximum of important informations about systems and games ...
With a big MEDIA size to be show on a 1080p TV, or 720p because all is made with % and auto fit the screen.

The skin is also MULTI LANG, you can switch US to FR with only a VARIABLE on the THEME.XML.
If some people want to help with other langage like ES, DE, IT, etc ... i can share my PSD file.
