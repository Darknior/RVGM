# RVGM : Retro/Retropie Video Game Museum


![RVGM Logo](_art/system-logo.png)

RVGM is the new name of my old XVGM project i've started on 2014 on XBOX.
- XVGM was a video theme for UnleashX, on the first Xbox, to launch Madmab and other emulators.
The Xbox Video Game Museum was abandoned because i have so many memory problems/crash and the xbox is now too old ... with old gamepad, no HDMI, not enough power for some new systems like Nintendo DS, etc...

- RVGM : Retro/Retropie Video Game Museum, is the new project designed to work on Retropie, with EmulationStation on a PI.
https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/16454/rvgm-retro-video-game-museum-skin-in-developpement

This theme is designed to show and write maximum of important informations about systems and games ...
With a big MEDIA size to be show on a 1080p TV, or 720p because all is made with % and auto fit the screen.

The theme is also MULTI LANG, you can switch US to FR with only a VARIABLE on the THEME.XML.
If some people want to help with other language like ES, DE, IT, etc... i can share my PSD file.
